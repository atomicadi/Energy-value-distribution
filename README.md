# Mathematical formulation of microcanonical normal mode sampling:
For a system with n normal modes, the Hamiltonian is simply the sum of the ehergies of independent harmonic oscillators:

$$
H =  E = \sum_{i=1}^n E_i = \sum_{i=1}^n [\frac{P_i^2 + \omega_i^2Q_i^2}{2}]
$$


</p>
To generate a microcanonical ensamble, random values of P<sub>i</sub> and Q$_i$ are chosen so that the states are uniformly distrubuted in the classical phase space defined by H(P,Q). The total vibration energy E$_{\nu}^0$ is rndomly divided among n normal modes.
